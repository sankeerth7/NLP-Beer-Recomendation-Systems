  - Uses TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to recommend beers based on textual descriptions and reviews.
- **Web Scraping:**
  - Automated data extraction from beer review websites using Selenium.
- **Natural Language Processing:**
  - Sentiment analysis and text preprocessing using SpaCy and NLTK.

## Dataset

## Future Improvements
- Integrate user-based collaborative filtering for hybrid recommendations.
- Expand the dataset by scraping additional sources.
- Deploy the system as a web application.
